# google-sheet-component
Basic demo for moving google sheets to web components.

1) You will need to get the local web running. To do so, in the project root, run `npm install`. Once the dependencies have been installed, you can run `npx serve` to get the server up and running. Once running, the terminal will display the available URL. _Note: once the page loads, you may need to click the `/src` directory button to access the actual page_
2) You will need to configure the custom element in index.html. To do so, fill in the empty element attributes.
